# Domain Description ::question:
The local beekeepers employed under our client Nature Bee Honey Company Sri Lanka so far keep track of their routine data about bee hives, production, pest infection situations, etc. on paper materials as rough notes or just memorize them roughly. Also most of the time they only keep tabs on the economic profit details of the production. So they miss out on analyzing production amounts compared to the status of each beehive and see whether they improved or did not improve in production. When it comes to the bee-products sales and marketing conducted under our client in Nature Bee Honey Company Sri Lanka, so far the processes were done via word to mouth marketing, products directly purchased from company outlet or delivered to given addresses by ordinary postal and parcel delivery methods which were all done through known social contacts only.

# Current System and its Limitations :closed_lock_with_key:
* Current System is based on manual maintenance of all records relevant to the customers, services and payments. When a customer wants to know products’ availability details, he/ she has to personally contact the company or visit the company outlet.
* Also the local beekeepers employed under our client keeps their records about bee hives, production, pest infection situations, etc. on paper or roughly memorize the details.
* It’s inconvenient for the customer to stay not updated about product details and availability, with less awareness about new products.
* With that, customer range and variety also becomes lesser.
* When beekeepers keep records on paper those materials would either get destroyed, misplaced or it would be hard to carry books to keep records when you go to inspect beehives.
* Memorized details related to beekeeping would either be forgotten or confused with similar data. Also a high amount of data will be hard to memorize and validity of them will be questionable with time.
* So far there hasn’t been any automated record keeping method for beekeepers employed under the company and there hasn’t been an organized online sales and marketing platform to be used by our client.

# Proposed Solution :white_check_mark:
* As a solution to the above discussed limitations in the current system, our suggestive solution to be introduced is MR. BEE; a web application for our client.
* Through this web based solution, customers of the company can access the system from anywhere at any time for their needs of products and the beekeepers would be provided with a record keeping and management aid.
* The proposed web application will automate all manual processes together with few more functionalities which will help to gain more user attraction.
* Through this application the beekeeper can keep records of data mainly under four categories;
1. Beehives: Identification details of each beehive box, start date, inspection dates and times, active status and temperament of each beehive’s bees, weight of each beehive, weather status on inspection date (rainfall, relative humidity, temperature data from resources online), changes made to each beehive, signs of diseases and treatments done, status of Queen Bee of each beehive, number of bee colonies in each beehive, etc.
1. Harvest: Harvesting date and time of each beehive, harvested product type and amount from each beehive (if raw honey; in kilograms, if bee colonies; in number, if royal gel; in kilograms)
1. Feedings: Feeding date and time of each beehive, type and amount of feed (in grams)
1. Production selling: Type of product and amount sold on the date of selling (if raw honey; in kilograms, if bee colonies; in number, if royal gel; in kilograms)

* The beekeeper can get additional knowledge related to beekeeping from the articles shared in the Information Sharing Hub in which the Manager and Division managers post articles with valid and updated information about beekeeping.
* Division managers can track the performance and production rate of beekeepers under his division through this application.
* The manager can assess the performance of division managers and beekeepers employed under the company through this application.
* Our client can reach a vast customer range and market their products via online through this application.
* The company can create awareness to customers about new products, and the customers can easily know about products’ (raw bee-products, quality added bee products, beekeeping equipment, etc.) availability and details related.

# Goals and Objectives :memo: :dart: :heavy_check_mark:
